# Specification Quality Checklist: Windows 11 ISO Builder & Debloater

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- One [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker remains on **FR-023** regarding how a "bootable/valid" image
  is verified in automation (structural/media-integrity checks vs. an actual VM boot test). This
  is a deliberate, scope-impacting question left for `/speckit.clarify` or stakeholder input.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- Tool names (DISM, Fido) appear only as named external dependencies/assumptions, not as
  implementation prescriptions, consistent with stakeholder-provided constraints.
